# Smart Chart Sprint Source Of Truth

Status: active living sprint document
Created: 2026-05-20
Repo: `beniandthe/smart-chart`
Active branch: `main`
Active baseline commit: `1b792df Merge pull request #4 from beniandthe/codex/symbol-ledger-recognition`
Trusted checkpoint reference: `c60bb46 Polish altered chord recognition trust`

## Purpose

This document is the working source of truth for Smart Chart sprint recovery and forward planning.

Use it before starting recognition, editor, simulator, or architecture work. After each sprint completes, update this file in place: move the finished sprint into the completed log, record verification evidence, and define the next sprint only after discussing the next priority.

If this document conflicts with older recognition or architecture planning docs, this document wins for current sprint execution. `docs/core-design-document.md` still wins for product intent.

## Current Baseline

`c60bb46` remains the trusted checkpoint reference. It represents the last known-good altered-chord trust polish baseline before the symbol-ledger drift/recovery work. Do not treat `c60bb46` as the active implementation baseline unless a future sprint explicitly chooses a reset.

Known drift after Sprint 8:

- `ChordInkRecognizer` is back to a narrower orchestration role and now calls an explicit recognition-candidate coordinator, semantic candidate sidecar, and semantic glyph contextualizer instead of semantic merge methods on the base composer.
- `ChordInkSymbolLedger` is diagnostics-only by policy and is gated off by default on the live recognition path.
- `StrokeClusterer.swift`, `StrokeClustererSupport.swift`, `ChordInkCandidateScoringPolicy.swift`, `ChordInkCandidateSelectionPolicy.swift`, `ChordInkCandidateTextVariantPolicy.swift`, `ChordInkSemanticGlyphContextualizer.swift`, and `ChordInkSemanticCandidateComposer.swift` contain the largest remaining recognition maintenance risk.
- `ChordInkCandidateComposer.swift` now delegates scoring to `ChordInkCandidateScoringPolicy`, glyph selection to `ChordInkCandidateSelectionPolicy`, text variants to `ChordInkCandidateTextVariantPolicy`, and no longer owns recognition-level semantic candidate merging.
- `ChordInkCandidateSelectionPolicy.swift` is intentionally a behavior-preserving move of the old selection rules. Do not retune those thresholds without a new recognition sprint and fixture evidence.
- `ChordInkCandidateTextVariantPolicy.swift` is intentionally a behavior-preserving move of the old text alias/expansion rules. Do not retune those expansions without fixture evidence.
- `ChordInkSemanticGlyphContextualizer.swift` is intentionally a behavior-preserving move of the old contextual glyph promotion rules. Do not retune those promotions without fixture evidence.
- `ChordInkSemanticCandidateComposer.swift` remains large; it owns semantic candidate recipes and shared suffix-shape helpers that should be split only as behavior-preserving refactors.
- The old handwriting plan and current-architecture audit are explicitly marked historical/stale when they conflict with this file.
- The full ink fixture archive remains test-only evidence, not runtime authority or user handwriting training data. Default recognition, cluster, and glyph tests now use a compact transferable regression suite; full archive/captured coverage runs are opt-in through `SMART_CHART_FULL_INK_FIXTURES=1`.
- Sprint 36 retired count-based captured handwriting coverage gates as active validation. Fixture capture UI now uses regression-fixture wording so debug capture cannot imply ongoing personal training.
- Fixture pruning/deletion remains deferred. Sprint 15 changes default test authority, not the archived fixture files.
- PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) merged the recovery branch into `main`; it is no longer the active review surface.
- The local duplicate `SmartChartTests/Recognition/* 2.swift` files found during Sprint 12 were removed after explicit approval; no duplicate files remain in that directory.
- No tracked cache/raster/direct-ink detour files remain in the current tree; remaining bloat is inside the current recognition path and broad editor surfaces.
- `EditorView.swift` no longer owns chord confirmation/correction sheet UI, rhythm confirmation sheet UI, or the shared flow layout after Sprint 19, but it remains broad at roughly `1544` lines. `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` no longer owns chord edit overlay geometry, measure resize handle geometry, active ink-scope support, saved ink image rendering, active ink persistence write-back decisions, chord ink bounds/OCR image rendering, gesture/targeting support, note-selection lasso targeting, chord ink recognition target selection, chord recognition timing log formatting, chord recognition scheduling/continuation policy, rhythmic notation finalization policy/apply helpers, interaction-mode recognizer/canvas/tool policy, chord recognition request-state bookkeeping, or prepared recognition/OCR execution after Sprint 37, but it remains the largest live editor bridge at roughly `1126` lines.
- Sprint 34 audited the remaining editor-to-recognition execution path and found it is no longer obvious cleanup. The remaining chord path crosses async recognition, optional OCR, trust policy, proposal routing, chart mutation, diagnostics, and chord ink clearing, so further extraction should wait for an explicit recognition-session boundary design or product validation evidence.
- Sprint 37 implemented the first `ChordInkRecognitionSession` boundary defined in `docs/smart-chart-recognition-session-boundary-design-2026-05-25.md`. UIKit/PencilKit state, mode/scope guards, stale request validation, continuation-grace requeue, proposal routing, chart mutation, diagnostics, and chord ink clearing remain outside the session; the session owns prepared recognition execution, optional OCR evidence, timing construction, and main-thread payload delivery.
- Sprint 38 added app-target coverage proving the recognition session skips OCR sidecar work when the primary recognition decision does not need ambiguity evidence, even when an OCR provider exists. This is test-only hardening; it does not change runtime recognition behavior.
- Sprint 39 added a bounded renderer product-proof test using exactly three fixed ink fixtures (`C`, `Db7(b9)`, and `G/B`) to prove ink strokes can recognize into structured chords, clear page chord ink after commit, and appear in exported PDF text. This is product proof, not corpus expansion or training authority.
- Sprint 40 added bounded visual renderer QA for representative sample charts plus the Sprint 39 product-proof path, then fixed export-only defects found by that pass: late-measure chord/timing labels now shift left instead of clipping, and exported pages explicitly paint a white background for stable PDF thumbnails and image conversion.
- Sprint 41 centralized the successful chord-ink commit contract in `Chart.commitRecognizedChordInk`: a supported candidate appends a structured `ChordEvent`, stores the source ink evidence on that event, and clears the active chord ink pass; a failed target lookup leaves the active chord ink intact.

## Product North Star

The product workflow remains:

```text
open -> write -> recognize -> snap -> fix -> export
```

Product rules:

- Smart Chart is chord-first and rhythm-aware, not full notation software.
- Native Apple Pencil writing feel matters more than custom capture workarounds.
- Recognition proposes; structured chart objects decide.
- Correction speed matters more than perfect recognition.
- Raw ink should support reinterpretation, but the chart must not depend on raw ink alone.
- Recognition architecture must be writer-agnostic by default. Do not design, tune, or expand recognition systems around one person's repeated chord-writing passes.
- Any future personalization must be explicit user-specific product behavior with a separate opt-in data boundary. Until then, real Pencil validation is observation/regression evidence only, not training.
- Current chord-entry rule: accepting/rendering a chord consumes the chord-writing pass and clears the live chord ink layer, including other unrendered strokes from that pass. Do not preserve leftover chord ink after commit unless a future product sprint explicitly changes the writing workflow.

## Source-Of-Truth Pipeline

The live chord-recognition pipeline must converge to:

```text
native PKCanvasView ink
-> PencilKitInkAdapter
-> StrokeClusterer
-> GestureTemplateRecognizer
-> ChordInkCandidateComposer
-> ChordRecognitionCompendium / ChordSymbolParser
-> ChordInkRecognitionPolicy plus optional trust sidecar
-> structured ChordEvent commit
```

Current sidecars:

- OCR sidecar: optional, ambiguity-only, compendium-gated.
- Symbol ledger: diagnostics-only evidence, not a renderer or final chord authority.
- Diagnostic recorder/audit script: tooling path for simulator and archived passes, not product behavior.

Deferred sidecars:

- Raster/classifier evidence.
- Incremental symbol cache/session state.
- Fixture corpus pruning or deletion.
- CoreML/HOMUS expansion.

## Authority Rules

These rules are hard boundaries for Sprint 1 and future recognition work:

- `ChordRecognitionCompendium` and `ChordSymbolParser` are the only final validators for accepted chord tokens.
- `ChordInkCandidateComposer` is the only layer that should compose glyph columns into final chord-string candidates.
- `ChordInkRecognizer` should orchestrate the pipeline and collect metrics; it should not keep growing new semantic candidate authorities.
- `ChordRecognitionTrustArbiter` may decorate or support a primary decision, but it must not bypass compendium validation.
- Raw OCR text must never render or appear as a trusted suggestion unless it normalizes through the compendium.
- `ChordInkSymbolLedger` may explain or audit a result, but it must not auto-render a different answer on its own.
- Recognition must not own beat placement. The editor/layout layer decides where a structured `ChordEvent` lands.
- The editor owns chord ink lifecycle. Under the current product flow, a committed `ChordEvent` clears the chord ink layer instead of carrying forward unprocessed chord strokes.
- Native `PKCanvasView` stays the writing renderer unless a future sprint explicitly proves a better native-feeling path.
- Chord fixture capture is not a training loop. Add or keep fixtures only when they protect a transferable regression, represent a general chord/glyph shape, or document a product validation finding that should apply beyond one writer.
- Do not use the `Chord Writing Test Chart`, fixture watcher, or copied fixture JSON as a standing corpus-expansion habit. They are debug/regression tools.

## Active Sprint

### Sprint 42: Real Pencil Product Loop Validation Decision

Status: queued after Sprint 41 GitHub verification.

Goal: decide whether to run a short real Pencil validation pass against `open -> write -> recognize -> snap -> fix -> export`, or choose another product-evidence sprint if hardware validation is not available. This must remain product proof, not a recognition-training loop.

Current state:

- The app opens directly to Projects/Library.
- Workspace and Settings placeholder tabs are no longer active navigation.
- The chord-writing test chart entry point remains available only under debug/simulator Developer Tools.
- The local Pro entitlement switch is debug/simulator-only until StoreKit or a real purchase path exists.
- The Library no longer has an oversized hero card; the top surface is a compact Local library header, New Chart action, chart count, capacity text, and the chart list.
- Unused plan-summary and upgrade-summary marketing copy accessors were removed from the active Library model path.
- `EditorView.swift` now delegates chord confirmation and chord correction sheet UI to `ChordInkSheetViews.swift`.
- `EditorView.swift` now delegates rhythm confirmation sheet UI to `RhythmicNotationConfirmationSheetView.swift`.
- `FlowLayout` is a shared editor component instead of a private type embedded in `EditorView.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates chord edit overlay geometry, control hit frames, and overlay hit testing to `LeadSheetChordEditOverlayGeometry.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates measure resize handle geometry and hit target creation to `LeadSheetMeasureResizeGeometry.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates active ink-scope resolution, page/chord writing frames, and active-scope drawing-data lookup to `LeadSheetActiveInkScope.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates saved page, chord, and rhythmic-notation ink image rendering to `LeadSheetSavedInkRenderer.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates active ink persistence write-back decisions to `LeadSheetActiveInkScope.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates chord ink render-bounds calculation and OCR image rendering to `LeadSheetChordInkImageRenderer.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates shared tap/move target geometry and chord-move drag state to `LeadSheetCanvasInteractionTargeting.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates note-selection lasso frame calculation and incidental tap-dot filtering to `LeadSheetNoteSelectionLassoTargeting.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates chord ink recognition target selection and target-measure scoring to `LeadSheetChordInkRecognitionTargeting.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates chord recognition timing storage and debug timing log formatting to `LeadSheetChordInkRecognitionTiming.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates chord recognition idle-delay selection and continuation-grace policy to `LeadSheetChordInkRecognitionScheduling.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates rhythmic notation finalization policy, quantization framing, live drawing persistence, and rhythm-map apply/ink-clear helper logic to `LeadSheetRhythmicNotationFinalization.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates interaction-mode recognizer enablement, overlay visibility, canvas interactivity, ink tool selection, and reset-decision policy to `LeadSheetInteractionModeStatePolicy.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates chord recognition request-state bookkeeping to `LeadSheetChordInkRecognitionRequestState.swift`.
- `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` now delegates prepared recognition/OCR execution and timing payload construction to `ChordInkRecognitionSession.swift`.
- Sprint 34 documented the remaining chord recognition execution path in `docs/smart-chart-editor-recognition-execution-audit-2026-05-24.md`.
- Sprint 35 documented the future recognition-session boundary in `docs/smart-chart-recognition-session-boundary-design-2026-05-25.md`.
- Sprint 36 reset recognition policy and debug fixture language around generalization: recognition is writer-agnostic by default, captured handwriting is regression/archive evidence only, and any future personalization requires explicit opt-in product design.
- Sprint 37 implemented the first behavior-preserving `ChordInkRecognitionSession` boundary and added app-target tests for main-thread payload delivery plus OCR gating.
- Sprint 38 added app-target session coverage proving OCR is skipped for clear primary decisions even when an OCR provider exists.
- Sprint 39 added bounded renderer product proof with three fixed ink fixtures that cross recognition, structured chord commit, chord ink clearing, and PDF export text.
- Sprint 40 added visual renderer QA for two representative structured charts and the bounded ink product-proof path, fixed late-measure PDF label clipping, and made exported PDF pages paint an explicit white background for stable raster/thumbnail previews.
- Sprint 41 centralized the writing-to-render commit rule in the chart model: successful chord-ink commits append a structured chord with source ink evidence and clear the active chord ink pass; failed commits keep the ink available.
- The user has approved continuing one scoped cleanup sprint at a time until the current audit/cleanup plan reaches a necessary approval point or is complete.

Candidate Sprint 42 directions:

- Real Pencil validation sprint: verify the recovered `open -> write -> recognize -> snap -> fix -> export` loop with a short manual checklist and a small target set. This must measure product behavior and renderer trust; it must not create another one-writer training pass.
- Product evidence fallback sprint: if real Pencil validation and visual QA must wait, pick a repo-local product surface with direct user value and clear evidence, such as Library organization or correction workflow friction.
- Recognition-session follow-up sprint: only if new evidence shows a boundary bug or maintenance hotspot, keep any work behavior-preserving and keep policy/UI/commit/chord-ink clearing outside the session.
- Continue editor surface cleanup with another small modal/subview extraction from `EditorView.swift` only if the bridge file split is higher risk than it looks.
- Continue app-shell/product polish only if the next Library need is real organization work such as search, sort, archive, or import.
- Split semantic candidate recipes into smaller behavior-preserving files only if review surface still feels too large.
- Discuss full fixture archive pruning only as repository/data hygiene, not as recognition training.
- Repeat visual renderer QA only when a new export/layout defect appears; the baseline Sprint 40 artifacts are already in place.

Non-goals for Sprint 42:

- No recognition score retuning, parser/compendium changes, or fixture deletion.
- No StoreKit implementation unless explicitly selected.
- No removal of debug/simulator chord-entry tooling.
- No direct change to the current chord ink lifecycle rule; rendered chord still clears the chord ink pass.
- No PencilKit replacement, simulator input workaround, or visual product redesign.
- No moving auto-render/confirmation, structured `ChordEvent` commit, diagnostics, continuation-grace requeue, or chord ink clearing into the recognition session.
- No continuous personal sample capture, hidden training loop, fixture-count goal, or recognition tuning based on one writer's repeated test chords.

### Sprint 1: Code Cleanup First

- status: complete
- final commit: `e040332 Document and clean up recognition sprint one`
- summary: Recovered the streamlined recognition architecture without score retuning. Symbol-ledger diagnostics are opt-in, semantic candidate construction moved out of `ChordInkRecognizer` into composer-owned code, and `StrokeClusterer` support helpers were split into `StrokeClustererSupport.swift` as a behavior-preserving refactor.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `350` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures using `OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS=--strip-disallowed-xattrs`; `git diff --check` passed.
- unresolved follow-up: `docs/handwriting-recognition-implementation-plan.md` and `docs/current-architecture-audit.md` remain historical/stale when they conflict with this file; no fresh user-facing `Chord Writing Test Chart` pass was run after cleanup because Sprint 1 was behavior-preserving and covered by existing recognition fixtures; branch still needs push/PR for GitHub checks.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 2 is documentation authority cleanup plus PR/CodeQL hardening.

### Sprint 2: Documentation Authority And PR Hardening

- status: complete
- commit range: `2eedd48 Open sprint two authority cleanup` through `4ff784e Clarify sprint two doc authority`, plus the Sprint 2 closeout entry in this file
- summary: Marked stale planning docs as historical, split `README.md` authority links into active and historical groups, pushed `codex/symbol-ledger-recognition`, and opened draft PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) as the GitHub review surface for the recovery branch.
- tests and evidence: `git diff --check` passed; trailing whitespace scan found no hits; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures. PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) showed Dependency Review, SwiftPM, and iOS simulator checks passing before this closeout push; CodeQL was still pending at closeout.
- unresolved follow-up: PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) is draft and CodeQL/rerun checks need one final review before merge readiness. Sprint 3 is intentionally not selected yet.
- next sprint candidate: Review PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) status first, then choose between fixture tiering, composer scoring extraction, or product/editor polish.

### Sprint 3: Fixture Corpus Runtime Cleanup

- status: complete locally; PR checks must be rechecked after push
- commit range: `19b1b1e Close sprint two source of truth` through the Sprint 3 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Kept the full `646`-file ink fixture corpus default-on, added a decoded corpus cache to the test-only `InkFixtureLoader`, preserved deterministic fixture ordering and named fixture loading, and documented the fixture runtime policy in `SmartChartTests/Fixtures/Ink/README.md`.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter InkFixtureLoaderTests` passed with `2` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed. No fixture JSON files changed.
- GitHub evidence before the Sprint 3 push: PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) had Dependency Review, SwiftPM, and iOS simulator checks passing; CodeQL was still pending.
- unresolved follow-up: recheck PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) after the Sprint 3 push; full critical/full fixture tiering remains deferred until test runtime becomes a proven blocker.
- next sprint candidate: Update the PR for any CodeQL/CI result first, otherwise choose between composer scoring extraction and product/editor polish.

### Sprint 4: Composer Scoring Policy Extraction

- status: complete locally; PR checks must be rechecked after push
- commit range: `a91af92 Close sprint three fixture corpus cleanup` through the Sprint 4 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Extracted `ChordInkCandidateScoringPolicy.swift` from `ChordInkCandidateComposer.swift`, moved `ChordInkCandidateComposerScoring` with the scoring policy, and left candidate selection, text variants, semantic sidecars, and score constants unchanged.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkCandidateComposerTests` passed with `49` tests, `0` failures; `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `39` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed.

- unresolved follow-up: recheck PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) after the Sprint 4 push. The composer still owns glyph candidate selection, text variant expansion, and semantic sidecar candidate injection.
- next sprint candidate: Choose between another behavior-preserving composer split, semantic sidecar extraction, or a return to product/editor polish.

### Sprint 5: Semantic Sidecar Boundary Cleanup

- status: complete locally; PR checks must be rechecked after push
- commit range: `236f55d Close sprint four composer scoring extraction` through the Sprint 5 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Replaced the semantic `ChordInkCandidateComposer` extension with explicit sidecar types. `ChordInkRecognitionCandidateComposer` now coordinates base composition, semantic sidecar injection, and timing metrics, while `ChordInkSemanticCandidateComposer` owns semantic candidate recipes and contextual glyph promotion helpers. Candidate scores, semantic confidence constants, compendium validation, and recognition acceptance policy were unchanged.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkCandidateComposerTests` passed with `49` tests, `0` failures; `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `39` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed.

- unresolved follow-up: recheck PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) after the Sprint 5 push. `ChordInkCandidateComposer.swift` still owns glyph candidate selection and text variant expansion, and `ChordInkSemanticCandidateComposer.swift` still needs a later behavior-preserving split.
- next sprint candidate: Choose between composer glyph-selection extraction, semantic contextualizer split, or a return to product/editor polish.

### Sprint 6: Composer Glyph-Selection Extraction

- status: complete locally; PR checks must be rechecked after push
- commit range: `267cfaf Close sprint five semantic sidecar boundary` through the Sprint 6 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Extracted glyph candidate selection and promotion rules from `ChordInkCandidateComposer.swift` into `ChordInkCandidateSelectionPolicy.swift`. The base composer now keeps sequence generation, text variant expansion, scoring delegation, and result metrics only. Selection thresholds, candidate promotion order, text variants, semantic sidecars, score constants, and recognition acceptance policy were unchanged.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkCandidateComposerTests` passed with `49` tests, `0` failures; `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `39` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed.

- unresolved follow-up: recheck PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) after the Sprint 6 push. `ChordInkCandidateComposer.swift` still owns text variant expansion, and `ChordInkSemanticCandidateComposer.swift` still needs a later behavior-preserving split.
- next sprint candidate: Choose between text variant extraction, semantic contextualizer split, or a return to product/editor polish.

### Sprint 7: Composer Text-Variant Extraction

- status: complete locally; PR checks must be rechecked after push
- commit range: `5cbc58f Close sprint six composer selection extraction` through the Sprint 7 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Extracted glyph text aliases, canonical minor-sixth display normalization, and compact/wrapper/slash lookalike text expansions from `ChordInkCandidateComposer.swift` into `ChordInkCandidateTextVariantPolicy.swift`. The base composer now keeps selected sequence generation, scoring delegation, result de-duplication, and composition metrics only. Variant expansion rules, selection rules, semantic sidecars, score constants, and recognition acceptance policy were unchanged.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkCandidateComposerTests` passed with `49` tests, `0` failures; `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `39` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed.

- summary: Extracted contextual glyph promotion from `ChordInkSemanticCandidateComposer.swift` into `ChordInkSemanticGlyphContextualizer.swift` and made `ChordInkRecognizer` call that sidecar explicitly. Semantic candidate recipes, contextual promotion thresholds, text variants, candidate selection, score constants, and recognition acceptance policy were unchanged.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `39` tests, `0` failures; `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1 --filter ChordInkCandidateComposerTests` passed with `49` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint1` passed with `310` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed. PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) had Dependency Review, SwiftPM, iOS simulator, Analyze Swift, and CodeQL passing on `72cd12e`.
- unresolved follow-up: `ChordInkSemanticCandidateComposer.swift` still owns many semantic candidate recipes and shared suffix-shape helpers; `StrokeClusterer.swift` and `StrokeClustererSupport.swift` remain large.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 9 is PR merge readiness.

### Sprint 9: PR Merge Readiness

- status: complete; PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) was approved by the user to move out of draft
- commit range: `61caeb9 Open sprint nine merge readiness` through the Sprint 10 kickoff commit containing this entry
- summary: Recorded green Sprint 8/Sprint 9 CI evidence, refreshed the PR body with the recovered pipeline and sprint sequence, reviewed PR blockers, and kept Sprint 9 as documentation/metadata only. No recognition, editor, PencilKit, fixture, scoring, or sidecar behavior changed.
- tests and evidence: PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) had Dependency Review, SwiftPM, iOS simulator, Analyze Swift, and CodeQL passing on `61caeb9`. `git diff --check` passed for the Sprint 10 kickoff doc update.
- unresolved follow-up: recheck PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) after the Sprint 10 kickoff push. The PR is large and review-required; the main review risk remains size, especially the full ink fixture corpus and large recognition implementation files.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 10 is product/editor polish audit.

### Sprint 10: Product/Editor Polish Audit

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- commit range: `192c6c0 Open sprint ten product editor polish` through the Sprint 10 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Audited the recovered app against `open -> write -> recognize -> snap -> fix -> export`, then shipped the smallest user-facing fixes found in the live loop. The editor page now fits the portrait iPad viewport, export stays reachable from chord-entry and note-correction modes, and exported PDFs no longer leak editor-only placeholder copy into empty measures. No recognition scoring, parser authority, PencilKit capture policy, fixture corpus, or recognition sidecar behavior changed.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint10 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint10` passed with `311` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `352` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures using `OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS=--strip-disallowed-xattrs`; `git diff --check` passed.
- live app evidence: on the explicit iOS 26.4 iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator, `Chord Writing Test Chart` opened in `Chord` mode with the full title visible and page inside the viewport; export was enabled from chord-entry mode; Pro Preview reached PDF preview; empty measures exported as clean grids without `Tap the measure...` placeholder text. `Turnaround Study` proved the correction loop by changing rendered `C7` to `F7`, then restoring it to `C7`. A fresh Chord Writing Test Chart accepted synthetic simulator strokes into the recognition proposal flow, surfaced `Confirm Chord`, and committed typed `C7` as a structured rendered chord; the disposable chart was reset afterward.
- GitHub evidence: PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) had Dependency Review, SwiftPM, iOS simulator, Analyze Swift, and CodeQL passing on `ffc97b6` before this closeout commit; the PR is not draft and remains blocked only by required review.
- unresolved follow-up: recheck PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) after the Sprint 10 closeout push. The synthetic simulator stroke did not produce a reliable auto-read, so future handwriting-quality work should use real Pencil/user input or fixture replay rather than retuning from simulator swipe shapes.
- next sprint candidate: choose between PR review/merge follow-through, another small product/editor polish pass, or behavior-preserving semantic candidate recipe splitting.

### Sprint 11: PR Review Follow-Through

- status: complete; PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) merged into `main`
- commit range: `66dc5d2 Document chord ink clear decision` through merge commit `1b792df Merge pull request #4 from beniandthe/codex/symbol-ledger-recognition`
- summary: Recorded the product decision that accepting/rendering a chord consumes the chord-writing pass and clears the live chord ink layer. The unresolved review suggestion to preserve unconsumed chord ink was answered as intentionally out of scope for the current workflow, then resolved after user approval. No runtime behavior changed.
- tests and evidence: `git diff --check` passed for the Sprint 11 doc update. PR [#4](https://github.com/beniandthe/smart-chart/pull/4) had Dependency Review, SwiftPM, iOS simulator, Analyze Swift, and CodeQL passing on `66dc5d2`; the review thread was resolved; the PR merged into `main` as `1b792df` on 2026-05-23.
- unresolved follow-up: no PR review blocker remains. Future work should start from `main`, not `codex/symbol-ledger-recognition`.
- next sprint candidate: choose between a post-merge product/app audit, another small editor polish pass, behavior-preserving semantic candidate recipe splitting, or real-input handwriting validation.

### Sprint 12: Post-Merge App Audit

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- commit range: `1e4ef82 Open sprint twelve post merge audit` through the Sprint 12 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Produced `docs/smart-chart-post-merge-app-audit-2026-05-23.md` as the written and visual post-merge app/architecture audit. The audit maps the whole app, app shell/persistence, user workflow, chord recognition pipeline, editor/export system, authority boundaries, live runtime paths, debug/tooling paths, local drift, bloat risks, and Sprint 13-15 recommendations.
- tests and evidence: main commit `31f1dde Start sprint twelve app audit` had SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift passing on GitHub. Local audit verification initially found `14` untracked duplicate `SmartChartTests/Recognition/* 2.swift` files that were byte-identical to tracked tests but broke SwiftPM discovery.
- unresolved follow-up: the duplicate files required explicit cleanup approval before local verification could be clean again; Sprint 13 handled that approved cleanup and live smoke.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 13 local hygiene and product smoke.

### Sprint 13: Local Hygiene And Product Smoke

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- commit range: post-`31f1dde` cleanup through the Sprint 13 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Removed the `14` untracked duplicate `SmartChartTests/Recognition/* 2.swift` files after explicit user approval and proved the merged app path from `main`. No tracked fixture corpus, recognition score, parser, compendium, or chord ink lifecycle behavior changed.
- tests and evidence: `find SmartChartTests/Recognition -maxdepth 1 -name '* 2.swift' -print` returned no files; `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint12` passed with `311` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures after duplicate cleanup; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `352` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures on iPad Air 11-inch (M4), iOS 26.4.1.
- live app evidence: launched `Smart Chart`, verified the Projects library, opened `Chord Writing Test Chart`, entered chord mode, opened export from the editor, reached PDF preview/share, opened `Turnaround Study`, and verified rendered chord selection affordance. Correction behavior remains covered by automated chart editing and iOS simulator tests; no fragile coordinate-only correction edit was forced during smoke.
- unresolved follow-up: the library still exposes prototype debug/test-chart surface in debug/simulator builds and Workspace/Settings remain placeholder app-shell decisions.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 14 editor surface boundary cleanup.

### Sprint 14: Editor Surface Boundary Cleanup

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- commit range: post-Sprint 13 cleanup through the Sprint 14 closeout commit containing this entry
- summary: Reduced duplicated bridge coordination in `LeadSheetCanvasHostView` by extracting the repeated SwiftUI-to-UIKit property and callback wiring into one private `configure(_:context:)` helper. Native `PKCanvasView` behavior, chord recognition, chord ink lifecycle, placement, correction, and export behavior were unchanged.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint14` passed with `311` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `352` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures on iPad Air 11-inch (M4), iOS 26.4.1; `git diff --check` passed.
- unresolved follow-up: `EditorView.swift` and `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` remain broad surfaces; future work should continue with one small behavior-preserving extraction at a time.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 15 decision point for user input.

### Sprint 15: Recognition Corpus And Runtime Authority Debloat

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- summary: Decoupled the default recognition test lane from the full captured handwriting archive. `InkFixtureLoader` now exposes a compact default regression suite plus an explicit `SMART_CHART_FULL_INK_FIXTURES=1` archive lane. Recognizer, glyph, and cluster tests use the compact suite by default while preserving full archive checks as opt-in. Captured fixture coverage tests moved behind the opt-in archive gate, and fixture docs now state that captured samples are regression evidence, not continuous training data or runtime authority.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint15` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `SMART_CHART_FULL_INK_FIXTURES=1 swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint15-full` passed with `315` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; focused loader/recognizer/glyph/cluster/archive-integrity checks passed; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- behavior boundary: no fixture JSON files were deleted; no recognition score, parser, compendium, PencilKit, editor, chord ink lifecycle, or app runtime behavior changed.
- unresolved follow-up: the full fixture archive still exists and may need future repository/data hygiene discussion, but it is no longer default recognition authority. The next recognition-maintenance sprint should continue to avoid score retuning until it has real-input evidence.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 16 decision point for user input.

### Sprint 16: App Shell Product Surface Debloat

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- summary: Removed placeholder Workspace and Settings tabs from the active app shell, keeping Projects/Library as the first app surface. Moved the debug/simulator chord-writing test chart entry point out of the Library hero into a collapsed Developer Tools section, and gated the local Pro entitlement switch/debug copy so release-style surfaces no longer show a prototype-only purchase path.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint16` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator.
- visual evidence: simulator screenshot after launch showed Projects as the only top-level app surface, no Workspace/Settings tab bar, existing projects visible, and debug Developer Tools tucked below the project list.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, or StoreKit behavior changed. Debug/simulator chord-entry tooling remains available.
- unresolved follow-up: Library hero/free-tier copy still reads broad and marketing-like; a future product polish sprint can make it denser and more work-focused. StoreKit remains intentionally unimplemented.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 17 decision point for user input.

### Sprint 17: Working Library Surface Debloat

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- summary: Reworked the Projects/Library screen from a hero-led landing surface into a denser working chart list. The top area now uses a compact Local library header, New Chart action, chart count, and concise capacity text; chart rows are tighter and use smaller radii; debug Developer Tools remain collapsed below the chart list. Removed unused plan-summary and upgrade-summary accessors that were only carrying marketing copy through the Library model path.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint17` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.
- visual evidence: simulator screenshot after launch showed the Projects navigation title, compact Local library header, New Chart button, immediate visible chart rows, selected-chart affordance, and collapsed Developer Tools with no oversized hero card.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, chart persistence, entitlement rules, StoreKit, or export behavior changed.
- unresolved follow-up: Library organization remains minimal. Search, sort, archive, import, or richer project metadata should wait for an explicit future product sprint rather than creeping in as surface polish.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 18 decision point for user input.

### Sprint 18: Chord Sheet Boundary Extraction

- status: complete; final closeout commit is the commit containing this entry
- summary: Moved chord ink confirmation and rendered-chord correction sheet UI, their pending DTOs, and fixture-copy status out of `EditorView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/ChordInkSheetViews.swift`. Moved the shared wrapping chip layout into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/FlowLayout.swift`. This reduced `EditorView.swift` from roughly `2183` lines to roughly `1683` lines while keeping editor orchestration in place.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint18` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.
- visual evidence: simulator screenshot after launch confirmed the app still opens to the compact Projects/Local library surface. Sprint 18 intentionally made no visible product change.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, chart persistence, entitlement rules, StoreKit, or export behavior changed. Chord accept, keep-ink, clear/rewrite, correction, and debug fixture-copy callbacks remain wired through `EditorView`.
- unresolved follow-up: `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` remains the largest live editor bridge at roughly `1622` lines, and `EditorView.swift` still owns several modal/editor subviews. Continue one behavior-preserving extraction at a time.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 19 decision point for user input.

### Sprint 19: Rhythmic Confirmation Sheet Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `7fb205f`
- final closeout commit: `7fb205f Extract rhythm confirmation view`
- summary: Moved rhythmic notation confirmation pending state and sheet UI out of `EditorView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/RhythmicNotationConfirmationSheetView.swift`. Removed the rhythm confirmation label helper from `EditorView.swift` and kept the existing shared `FlowLayout` component. This reduced `EditorView.swift` from roughly `1683` lines to roughly `1544` lines while keeping editor orchestration in place.
- tests and evidence: `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint19` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.
- visual evidence: simulator screenshot after launch confirmed the app still opens to the compact Projects/Local library surface. Sprint 19 intentionally made no visible product change.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence, entitlement rules, StoreKit, or export behavior changed. Rhythm confirmation accept/rewrite callbacks remain wired through `EditorView`.
- unresolved follow-up: `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` remains the largest live editor bridge at roughly `1622` lines, and `EditorView.swift` still owns note edit/time signature sheet UI. Continue one behavior-preserving extraction at a time.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 20 editor bridge cleanup gate.

### Sprint 20: Chord Edit Overlay Geometry Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `cfbc1ff`
- final closeout commit: `cfbc1ff Extract chord edit overlay geometry`
- summary: Moved chord edit overlay frame math, delete/move control frame calculation, chord edit hit targeting, and the transparent overlay hit-test view out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetChordEditOverlayGeometry.swift`. The bridge keeps only the mode gate and drawing call site. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1622` lines to roughly `1531` lines while keeping native ink and editor orchestration in place.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint20 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint20` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.
- visual evidence: simulator screenshot after launch confirmed the app still opens to the compact Projects/Local library surface. Sprint 20 intentionally made no visible product change.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence, entitlement rules, StoreKit, or export behavior changed. Chord edit delete, move, and review routing remain wired through `LeadSheetCanvasHostView`.
- unresolved follow-up: `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` remains the largest live editor bridge at roughly `1531` lines, with measure resize geometry, ink-scope support, gesture handling, ink persistence, recognition scheduling, and rhythm finalization still in one file. Continue one behavior-preserving extraction at a time.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 21 editor bridge cleanup gate.

### Sprint 21: Measure Resize Geometry Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `4d8a2c3`
- final closeout commit: `4d8a2c3 Extract measure resize geometry`
- summary: Moved measure resize handle frame calculation, touch expansion, hit target creation, and `ActiveMeasureResizeDrag` out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetMeasureResizeGeometry.swift`. The bridge keeps the mode gate, selected-measure lookup, and gesture state handling. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1531` lines to roughly `1479` lines while keeping native ink and editor orchestration in place.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint21 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint21` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.

- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence, entitlement rules, StoreKit, or export behavior changed. Measure resize gesture gating and chart update routing remain wired through `LeadSheetCanvasHostView`.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `4d8a2c3` passed CI and CodeQL on 2026-05-24, with CI covering SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift. Supabase and Expo suites remained queued with zero check runs and are not treated as current required app health.
- unresolved follow-up: `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` remains the largest live editor bridge at roughly `1479` lines, with active ink-scope support, gesture handling, ink persistence, recognition scheduling, and rhythm finalization still in one file. Continue one behavior-preserving extraction at a time.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 22 editor bridge cleanup gate.

### Sprint 22: Active Ink Scope Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `c567cf6`
- final closeout commit: `c567cf6 Extract active ink scope`
- summary: Moved active ink-scope resolution, page/chord writing frame helpers, and active-scope drawing-data lookup out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetActiveInkScope.swift`. The bridge keeps `PKCanvasView` sync, persistence, recognition scheduling, and editor orchestration. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1479` lines to roughly `1423` lines while keeping native ink behavior in place.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint22 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint22` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.

### Sprint 23: Saved Ink Renderer Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `00ec115`
- final closeout commit: `00ec115 Extract saved ink renderer`
- summary: Moved saved page ink, saved chord ink, and saved rhythmic-notation ink image rendering out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetSavedInkRenderer.swift`. The bridge keeps the draw-order gates, active-measure suppression, and chart data lookup. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1423` lines to roughly `1403` lines while keeping native ink display behavior in place.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint23 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint23` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.

### Sprint 24: Active Ink Persistence Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `d77fa98`
- final closeout commit: `d77fa98 Extract active ink persistence`
- summary: Moved the active ink persistence write-back decision out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` and into `LeadSheetActiveInkScope.swift`. The bridge still owns debounce/cancel timing, the current canvas drawing, local chart assignment, and `onChartChanged` callback routing. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1403` lines to roughly `1385` lines while keeping active ink persistence behavior in place.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint24 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint24` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.

- next sprint candidate: Sprint 25 editor bridge cleanup gate after Sprint 24 GitHub checks pass.

### Sprint 25: Chord Ink Image Renderer Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `395d756`
- final closeout commit: `395d756 Extract chord ink image renderer`
- summary: Moved chord ink render-bounds calculation and OCR crop/image rendering out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetChordInkImageRenderer.swift`. The host still owns OCR request gating through `ChordRecognitionTrustArbiter`, provider invocation, metrics, target placement, scheduling, and callbacks. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1385` lines to roughly `1352` lines while keeping OCR sidecar behavior and chord ink target placement in place.

### Sprint 26: Canvas Interaction Targeting Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `40f873f`
- final closeout commit: `40f873f Extract canvas interaction targeting`

### Sprint 29: Chord Recognition Timing Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `9f05177`
- final closeout commit: `9f05177 Extract chord recognition timing logging`
- summary: Moved chord recognition timing storage and debug timing log formatting out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetChordInkRecognitionTiming.swift`. The host still owns recognition scheduling, request cancellation, OCR gating, recognizer execution, continuation grace, proposal callbacks, and current chord ink clearing behavior. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1231` lines to roughly `1184` lines.

### Sprint 30: Chord Recognition Scheduling Policy Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `a6fd6c2`
- final closeout commit: `a6fd6c2 Extract chord recognition scheduling policy`
- summary: Moved chord recognition idle-delay selection and continuation-grace decision out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetChordInkRecognitionScheduling.swift`. The host still owns timers, request IDs, cancellation, OCR gating, recognizer execution, proposal callbacks, and current chord ink clearing behavior. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1184` lines to roughly `1182` lines while making the remaining scheduling policy explicit.

### Sprint 31: Rhythmic Notation Finalization Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `63356d7`
- final closeout commit: `63356d7 Extract rhythmic notation finalization`
- summary: Moved rhythmic notation selection-change/tap finalization policy, live rhythmic drawing persistence, quantization frame construction, and rhythm-map apply/ink-clear helper logic out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetRhythmicNotationFinalization.swift`. The host still owns selection restoration, callbacks, validation messaging, canvas drawing access, and current chord ink clearing behavior.

### Sprint 32: Interaction Mode State Policy Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `fe1701a`
- final closeout commit: `fe1701a Extract interaction mode state policy`
- summary: Moved interaction-mode recognizer enablement, chord edit overlay visibility/interactivity, page ink canvas interactivity, ink tool selection, and state-reset decision policy out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetInteractionModeStatePolicy.swift`. The host still owns applying UIKit state, cancelling pending chord recognition work, clearing active drags, resigning first responder, and current chord ink clearing behavior. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1176` lines to roughly `1159` lines.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint32 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint32` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.

### Sprint 33: Chord Recognition Request State Extraction

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `c238964`
- final closeout commit: `c238964 Extract chord recognition request state`
- summary: Moved chord ink recognition request-state bookkeeping out of `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` into `SmartChart/Features/Editor/Components/LeadSheetChordInkRecognitionRequestState.swift`. The helper owns the pending work item, active request ID, last recognized drawing data, and continuation-grace drawing data. The host still owns scheduling delays, request execution, target selection, OCR gating, recognizer invocation, timing logs, proposal callbacks, chart mutation, and current chord ink clearing behavior. This reduced `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` from roughly `1159` lines to roughly `1147` lines while grouping request state under a named boundary.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint33 --filter LeadSheetPageLayoutTests` passed with `27` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint33` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme test passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulator; `git diff --check` passed.
- visual evidence: simulator screenshot after launch confirmed the app still opens to the compact Projects/Local library surface. Sprint 33 intentionally made no visible product change.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence semantics, entitlement rules, StoreKit, export behavior, or mode behavior changed. Request-state movement is behavior-preserving only; the host still owns recognition execution.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `c238964` passed required GitHub Actions on 2026-05-24, with SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift passing. Supabase and Expo suites remained queued with zero check runs and are not treated as current required app health.
- unresolved follow-up: `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` remains the largest live editor bridge at roughly `1147` lines. The remaining chord recognition request execution, OCR gate, recognizer invocation, proposal callback, and chart-mutation path is more entangled than the state bookkeeping and should be reviewed before further extraction.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 34 editor bridge decision gate after Sprint 33 GitHub checks pass.

### Sprint 34: Editor Recognition Execution Audit

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `4f1de60`
- final closeout commit: `4f1de60 Audit editor recognition execution path`
- summary: Paused the editor bridge extraction sequence and audited the remaining live chord recognition execution path in `docs/smart-chart-editor-recognition-execution-audit-2026-05-24.md`. The audit maps the path from `PKCanvasView` drawing change through scheduling, request-state guarding, target selection, `PencilKitInkAdapter`, background `ChordInkRecognizer`, optional OCR sidecar, main-thread continuation grace, `EditorView` proposal routing, trust-policy auto-render/confirmation, structured `ChordEvent` commit, diagnostics, and chord ink clearing.
- tests and evidence: doc/audit-only; `git diff --check` passed. Sprint 34 made no runtime code changes.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence semantics, entitlement rules, StoreKit, export behavior, or mode behavior changed. The audit explicitly recommends stopping blind bridge extraction before the remaining execution/OCR/callback/chart-mutation path.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `4f1de60` passed required GitHub Actions on 2026-05-25, with SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift passing. Supabase and Expo suites remained queued with zero check runs and are not treated as current required app health.
- unresolved follow-up: choose Sprint 35 from product evidence or deliberate architecture design, not more automatic bridge slicing.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 35 product evidence or recognition-session design decision after Sprint 34 GitHub checks pass.

### Sprint 35: Recognition Session Boundary Design

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `09953fc`
- final closeout commit: `09953fc Design chord recognition session boundary`
- summary: Added `docs/smart-chart-recognition-session-boundary-design-2026-05-25.md` to define a future `ChordInkRecognitionSession` boundary before moving more of the live editor/recognition path. The design keeps UIKit/PencilKit state, active mode/scope guards, target selection, stale request validation, continuation-grace routing, proposal callbacks, auto-render/confirmation, chart mutation, diagnostics, and chord ink clearing outside the future session. The future session is limited to prepared recognition execution, optional OCR evidence, timing construction, and main-thread proposal payload delivery.
- tests and evidence: doc/design-only; `git diff --check` passed. Sprint 35 made no runtime code changes.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture, PencilKit, editor chord lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence semantics, entitlement rules, StoreKit, export behavior, mode behavior, OCR authority, or chord ink clearing changed.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `09953fc` passed required GitHub Actions on 2026-05-25, with SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift passing. Supabase and Expo suites remained queued with zero check runs and are not treated as current required app health.
- unresolved follow-up: choose whether the next architecture sprint should run real Pencil validation or implement the designed recognition-session boundary as a behavior-preserving code move.
- next sprint candidate: recognition generalization policy reset before selecting the next architecture sprint, because fixture capture language still implied a one-writer training habit.

### Sprint 36: Recognition Generalization Policy Reset

- status: complete; GitHub Actions passed on `6ab1d05`
- final closeout commit: `6ab1d05 Reset recognition fixture authority policy`
- summary: Made the writer-agnostic recognition rule explicit across the active source-of-truth, Sprint 34 audit, Sprint 35 recognition-session design, fixture README, and historical handwriting plan. Debug fixture capture wording now says `Copy Regression Fixture` and `Clear Ink`, and export errors refer to regression fixtures instead of ink samples. The old opt-in captured handwriting coverage count gates now skip even when `SMART_CHART_FULL_INK_FIXTURES=1`, so they no longer pressure the project to keep expanding one writer's captured sample corpus.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint36 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `40` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint36 --filter InkFixtureCoverageTests` passed with `32` tests, `32` skipped, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint36` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; opt-in retired coverage check `SMART_CHART_FULL_INK_FIXTURES=1 swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint36-full --filter InkFixtureCoverageTests` passed with `32` tests, `32` skipped, `0` failures and the retired-gates skip message; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `321` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) simulator; simulator foreground launch/screenshot stayed on SpringBoard with a `FBSOpenApplicationServiceErrorDomain` preflight-busy log, so Sprint 36 does not claim visual app-surface proof; `git diff --check` passed.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture JSON, PencilKit, chord ink lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence semantics, entitlement rules, StoreKit, export renderer behavior, mode behavior, OCR authority, or structured chord commit behavior changed. Runtime-facing changes are limited to debug/simulator fixture-copy wording and retired coverage-test gates.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `6ab1d05` passed required GitHub Actions on 2026-05-25, with SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift passing. Supabase and Expo suites remained queued with zero check runs and are not treated as current required app health.
- unresolved follow-up: real Pencil validation can observe generalization and record transferable regressions, but must not become a personal sample-collection loop. Future user-specific recognition or personalization requires explicit opt-in product architecture before any data is captured for that purpose.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 37 real Pencil validation or recognition-session implementation decision after Sprint 36 GitHub checks pass.

### Sprint 37: Recognition Session Boundary Implementation

- status: complete; required GitHub Actions passed
- final closeout commit: `f8019c6 Extract chord ink recognition session`
- summary: Implemented the first `ChordInkRecognitionSession` boundary from the Sprint 35 design. `LeadSheetCanvasHostView.swift` still prepares request inputs, owns mode/scope guards, target selection, stale-request validation, continuation-grace requeue, proposal callbacks, and current chord ink lifecycle. The new `ChordInkRecognitionSession.swift` owns only prepared background recognizer execution, primary decision calculation for OCR gating, optional OCR sidecar evidence, timing construction, and main-thread payload delivery. Added app-target `ChordInkRecognitionSessionTests` for main-thread payload delivery and OCR gating.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint37 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `40` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint37-full` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `323` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures, including the two new session tests; XcodeBuildMCP build/run succeeded on the configured iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) simulator; screenshot confirmed the app opens to the compact Projects/Local library surface; `git diff --check` passed.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture JSON, PencilKit, chord ink lifecycle, rhythm quantization, chart persistence semantics, entitlement rules, StoreKit, export behavior, mode behavior, OCR authority, auto-render/confirmation routing, structured `ChordEvent` commit, diagnostics, continuation-grace policy, or chord ink clearing changed.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `f8019c6` passed SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift on 2026-05-25.
- unresolved follow-up: real Pencil validation is now the product-preferred next step because the repo-local session boundary is in place. Any further repo-local session work must remain behavior-preserving and keep auto-render/confirmation, commit, diagnostics, continuation grace, and ink clearing outside the session.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 38 OCR-gate test hardening, then Sprint 39 real Pencil validation or product-evidence decision.

### Sprint 38: Recognition Session OCR Gate Test Hardening

- status: complete; required GitHub Actions passed
- final closeout commit: `85664a6 Harden chord recognition session OCR gate`
- summary: Added app-target coverage for the recognition-session OCR gate. `ChordInkRecognitionSessionTests` now proves that a clear primary recognition decision does not request OCR image generation, does not call the OCR provider, does not attach OCR candidates, and reports zero OCR candidate count even when an OCR provider is available.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint38 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `40` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint38-full` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `324` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures, including all three session tests; `git diff --check` passed.
- behavior boundary: test-only hardening. No production code, recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture JSON, PencilKit behavior, chord ink lifecycle, chart persistence semantics, OCR authority, auto-render/confirmation routing, structured `ChordEvent` commit, diagnostics, continuation-grace policy, or chord ink clearing changed.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `85664a6` passed SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift on 2026-05-25.
- unresolved follow-up: real Pencil validation requires human hardware input. If continuing repo-local before that input, choose a product-evidence sprint rather than hidden training, score tuning, or blind extraction.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 39 real Pencil validation or product-evidence decision after Sprint 38 GitHub checks pass.

### Sprint 39: Bounded Ink Renderer Product Proof

- status: complete; required GitHub Actions passed
- final closeout commit: `a0eb7a0 Add bounded renderer product proof`
- summary: Added an app-target renderer product-proof test that uses exactly three fixed ink fixtures (`C`, `Db7(b9)`, and `G/B`). The proof recognizes those strokes, commits structured `ChordEvent`s with source ink evidence, clears page chord ink after each commit, exports the chart through `PDFChartExporter`, and verifies the rendered PDF text contains the recognized chord output without editor placeholder copy.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint39 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `40` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint39-full` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `325` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures, including `RendererProductProofTests`; `git diff --check` passed.
- behavior boundary: test-only product proof. No production code, recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture JSON, PencilKit behavior, chord ink lifecycle, chart persistence semantics, OCR authority, auto-render/confirmation routing, diagnostics, StoreKit, or export renderer implementation changed.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `a0eb7a0` passed SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift on 2026-05-25.
- unresolved follow-up: real Pencil validation can use a small target set and visual renderer evidence, but must not become an open-ended captured-ink loop. Add new ink only for transferable product regressions.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 40 real Pencil renderer validation or visual renderer QA decision after Sprint 39 GitHub checks pass.

### Sprint 40: Visual Renderer QA

- status: complete; required GitHub Actions passed
- final closeout commit: `536d49d Add renderer visual QA proof`
- summary: Added `PDFRendererVisualQATests` as a bounded app-target visual QA harness for representative structured charts and the Sprint 39 product-proof path. The harness emits stable PDFs when `SMART_CHART_RENDERER_QA_OUTPUT` is set, records a manifest, verifies expected chart/chord text, rejects editor placeholder copy, and keeps the ink product-proof path capped at three fixed fixtures so it cannot drift into a personal handwriting training loop. The QA pass found and fixed two export renderer defects: late-measure chord/timing labels now shift left instead of clipping at the right edge, and `PDFChartExporter` paints an explicit white page background so raster previews and thumbnails do not render transparent pages as black.
- tests and evidence: `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `326` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures while writing QA PDFs to `/tmp/SmartChartRendererQA`; focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint40 --filter ChordInkRecognizerTests` passed with `40` tests, `1` skipped, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint40-full` passed with `315` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- visual evidence: generated `/tmp/SmartChartRendererQA/late-night-pocket-concert.pdf`, `/tmp/SmartChartRendererQA/turnaround-study-concert.pdf`, and `/tmp/SmartChartRendererQA/renderer-product-proof-concert.pdf`; rendered them to PNGs under `/tmp/SmartChartRendererQA/png` using `sips`; visually inspected all three. The final images show white page backgrounds, readable headers, intact representative chords including `Ab7(#11)`, `Bb△7`, `G-7`, `C7`, `C`, `Db7(b9)`, and `G/B`, and no editor placeholder text.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture JSON, PencilKit behavior, chord ink lifecycle, chart persistence semantics, OCR authority, auto-render/confirmation routing, diagnostics, StoreKit, or training policy changed. Production changes are limited to export renderer layout/background correctness.
- GitHub evidence: main commit `536d49d` passed SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift on 2026-05-25. Supabase and Expo suites remained queued with zero check runs and are not treated as current required app health.
- unresolved follow-up: real Pencil validation still requires human hardware input and should remain a short product-loop pass, not an open-ended sample capture loop.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 41 writing-to-render commit contract after Sprint 40 GitHub checks passed and the user asked to continue improving the writing-to-render pipeline.

### Sprint 41: Writing-To-Render Commit Contract

- status: complete locally; required GitHub Actions must be rechecked after push
- final closeout commit: the commit containing this entry
- summary: Centralized the successful chord-ink commit rule in `Chart.commitRecognizedChordInk`. The editor now calls one model-level operation that appends a structured `ChordEvent`, stores source ink evidence, and clears the active chord ink pass only after a successful append. If the target measure is unavailable, the operation returns `nil` and keeps the active chord ink available for retry. The bounded renderer proof and visual QA harness now use the same commit contract, so product evidence follows the same write-to-render path as the live editor instead of duplicating append/clear steps in tests.
- tests and evidence: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint41 --filter ChartEditingTests` passed with `31` tests, `0` failures; full `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint41-full` passed with `316` tests, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/audit_chord_entry_diagnostics.py scripts/import_chord_fixture.py scripts/watch_simulator_chord_fixtures.py` passed; `xcodegen generate` completed; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator `SmartChart` scheme passed with `327` passed, `36` skipped, `0` failures; `git diff --check` passed.
- behavior boundary: no recognition score, parser, compendium, fixture JSON, PencilKit behavior, OCR authority, auto-render/confirmation policy, diagnostics, StoreKit, export layout, or training policy changed. The chord ink lifecycle rule is unchanged, but is now enforced through one commit helper on success.
- GitHub evidence: pending after Sprint 41 closeout push. Before this sprint, main commit `536d49d` passed SwiftPM tests, iOS simulator tests, and Analyze Swift on 2026-05-25.
- unresolved follow-up: real Pencil validation still requires human hardware input and should test the same product contract with a small target set; it must not become repeated personal sample capture or recognition retuning.
- next sprint candidate: Sprint 42 real Pencil product-loop validation decision after Sprint 41 GitHub checks pass.

## Next Sprint Backlog

Use this queue for Sprint 42 after Sprint 41 GitHub checks pass. The user has approved continuing through the current audit/cleanup plan one scoped sprint at a time until a necessary approval/input point or plan completion.

- Run a short real Pencil validation sprint against the recovered `open -> write -> recognize -> snap -> fix -> export` loop before recognition tuning.
- Repeat visual renderer QA only when a new export/layout defect appears; Sprint 40 established the current PDF/PNG baseline.
- If real Pencil validation and renderer QA must wait, choose a repo-local product-evidence sprint with direct user value, such as Library organization or correction workflow friction.
- Inspect any remaining `ChordInkRecognitionSession` follow-up only if new evidence shows a boundary bug or maintenance hotspot, keeping UI, chart mutation, diagnostics, continuation grace, and chord ink clearing outside the session.
- Continue editor surface cleanup with another small modal/subview extraction from `EditorView.swift` if bridge extraction looks too entangled for a single sprint.
- Continue app-shell/product polish only if the next Library need is real organization work such as search, sort, archive, or import.
- Split semantic candidate recipes into smaller behavior-preserving files only if the review surface still feels too large.
- Discuss full fixture archive pruning only as repository/data hygiene, not as recognition training.

## Retired Or Stale Docs

Current authority:

- `docs/smart-chart-sprint-source-of-truth.md`: active sprint execution and recovery plan.
- `docs/smart-chart-post-merge-app-audit-2026-05-23.md`: Sprint 12 written and visual post-merge app/architecture audit.
- `docs/smart-chart-editor-recognition-execution-audit-2026-05-24.md`: Sprint 34 audit of the remaining editor-to-recognition execution boundary.
- `docs/smart-chart-recognition-session-boundary-design-2026-05-25.md`: Sprint 35 design for a future behavior-preserving recognition-session boundary.
- `docs/core-design-document.md`: product intent and design rules.
- `docs/developer-mvp-spec.md`: MVP scope, subordinate to the core design document.
- `docs/repo-github-recognition-audit-2026-05-20.md`: evidence snapshot for the current recovery plan.

Historical or stale context:

- `docs/handwriting-recognition-implementation-plan.md`: original recognition architecture plus historical pass notes. Use for background only until a future sprint rewrites it.
- `docs/current-architecture-audit.md`: stale because it predates live chord-entry recognition.
- `docs/architecture-reset-proposal.md`: useful historical proposal, not the active sprint plan.
- `docs/implementation-milestones.md`: older execution sequence; do not use it to override this document.

## Update Protocol

At sprint completion:

1. Run the required verification commands.
2. Record the final commit or commit range.
3. Move the active sprint summary into `Completed Sprints Log`.
4. Record any unresolved risks.
5. Discuss the next sprint before editing `Active Sprint`.
6. Keep prior completed entries intact.

Do not start a new recognition or editor sprint from memory alone. Reopen this document, the latest audit/pass evidence, and the current git state first.
