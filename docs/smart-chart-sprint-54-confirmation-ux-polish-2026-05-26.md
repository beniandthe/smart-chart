# Smart Chart Sprint 54: Confirmation UX Polish

Status: implemented; ready for bounded manual UX validation

## Goal

Make chord confirmation feel like a confident product interaction instead of a demo/debug sheet.

## Trigger

Sprint 52 proved the correction loop works. The next product issue is feel: when Smart Chart asks for confirmation, it should be clear, fast, reassuring, and easy to recover from.

## Product Rules

- Auto-render remains the preferred lane.
- Confirmation should feel positive, not like a failure state.
- The user should always see the currently selected chord clearly.
- The top suggestions should read as ranked choices, not raw debug chips.
- Manual entry should feel like a normal escape hatch.
- Rewrite and keep-ink actions should stay available but secondary.
- The loop must not trap the user in write -> wrong render -> delete -> rewrite.

## Implementation

- Redesigned `ChordInkConfirmationSheetView` with a status header, selected-chord preview, ranked suggestion rows, polished manual entry, and icon-labeled actions.
- Replaced raw recognizer reason text with user-facing status copy.
- Added return-key submission for manual entry.
- Polished `ChordCorrectionSheetView` to match the same interaction family.
- Kept all recognition, trust, parser, correction-memory, and chart mutation behavior unchanged.

## Verification Evidence

- XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator compile-only build passed for the `SmartChart` scheme with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Manual Validation

- Trigger a close-race confirmation and check that the sheet feels like choosing the intended chord, not debugging recognition.
- Select each suggestion and confirm the selected-chord preview updates clearly.
- Type a chord manually and submit with the keyboard return key.
- Use Keep Ink and Rewrite to confirm the secondary actions still route correctly.
- Correct an already-rendered chord and confirm that sheet feels consistent with the confirmation flow.
