# Smart Chart Sprint 54: Confirmation UX Polish

Status: complete; required GitHub Actions passed

## Goal

Make chord confirmation feel like a confident product interaction instead of a demo/debug sheet.

## Trigger

Sprint 52 proved the correction loop works. The next product issue is feel: when Smart Chart asks for confirmation, it should be clear, fast, reassuring, and easy to recover from.

## Product Rules

- Auto-render remains the preferred lane.
- Confirmation should feel positive, not like a failure state.
- The user should always see the currently selected chord clearly.
- The top suggestions should read as ranked choices, not raw debug chips.
- Manual entry should feel like a normal escape hatch.
- Rewrite and keep-ink actions should stay available but secondary.
- The loop must not trap the user in write -> wrong render -> delete -> rewrite.

## Implementation

- Redesigned `ChordInkConfirmationSheetView` as a centered, concise chooser: selected chord, top three candidates, manual input, and compact Accept/Keep Ink/Rewrite actions.
- Replaced raw recognizer reason text with user-facing status copy.
- Added return-key submission for manual entry.
- Polished `ChordCorrectionSheetView` to match the same interaction family.
- Kept all recognition, trust, parser, correction-memory, and chart mutation behavior unchanged.

## User Validation

- The first polish pass worked well in a real pass.
- The confirmation sheet still felt too information-heavy for the actual product flow.
- The next iteration should stay centered and concise: top three candidates, one manual input box, and clear accept/decline ink actions.
- The centered sheet felt much better in simulator validation.
- The pass metadata exposed duplicate diagnostic rows for the same confirmed chord because render-handoff timing appended a second copy of the original commit diagnostic.

## Metadata Follow-Up

- Updated render-handoff diagnostics to replace the matching commit diagnostic instead of appending a duplicate row.
- Kept one diagnostic row per chord event with the final render timing evidence filled in.
- Kept recognition, scoring, candidate ordering, confirmation rules, correction memory, and chart mutation behavior unchanged.

## Verification Evidence

- XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator compile-only build passed for the `SmartChart` scheme with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- GitHub Actions on `6133621 Polish chord confirmation UX` passed `SwiftPM tests`, `iOS simulator tests`, and `Analyze Swift`.
- Centered refinement local verification passed: XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator compile-only build for the `SmartChart` scheme with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`, plus `git diff --check`.
- GitHub Actions on `03305eb Simplify chord confirmation UX` passed `SwiftPM tests`, `iOS simulator tests`, and `Analyze Swift`.
- Metadata follow-up local verification passed: focused `swift test --scratch-path /tmp/SmartChartSwiftBuild-sprint54-diagnostics --filter ChordEntryDiagnosticsTests` passed with `8` tests and `0` failures; XcodeBuildMCP iOS simulator compile-only build passed for the `SmartChart` scheme with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`; `git diff --check` passed.
- GitHub Actions on `d5fb582 Avoid duplicate chord diagnostic rows` passed `SwiftPM tests`, `iOS simulator tests`, and `Analyze Swift`.

## Manual Validation

- Trigger a close-race confirmation and check that the sheet feels centered, concise, and easy to choose from.
- Select each of the top three suggestions and confirm the selected-chord preview updates clearly.
- Type a chord manually and submit with the keyboard return key.
- Use Keep Ink and Rewrite to confirm the secondary actions still route correctly.
- Correct an already-rendered chord and confirm that sheet feels consistent with the confirmation flow.
