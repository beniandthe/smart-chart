# Smart Chart Rhythm Section Side Sprint Plan

Status: complete locally; Rhythm Section core and V4 gate verified, deferred systems definition-gated
Date: 2026-05-27
Branch: `codex/rhythm-section-core-authoring`
Source of truth: `docs/smart-chart-sprint-source-of-truth.md`

## Purpose

This side sprint moves `Rhythm Section Sheet` from a behavior-locked designation into its own core authoring lane. The goal is not a new chart-layout engine yet; it is the smallest durable pass for measure actions, rhythm-lane auto-render, chord snapping, and below-staff free-hand articulations.

## Scope

- Keep Rhythm Section setup keyless and clefless.
- Keep starting time and starting measures.
- Preserve the hard minimum of one measure.
- Keep staff-line measures and chord lane above the staff.
- Keep rhythm notation inside the measure lane.
- Add Rhythm Section free-hand articulation objects below the staff only.
- Keep chord snapping routed through `MeasureRhythmMap`, resolved rhythm slots, and beat fallback.

## Implementation Steps

1. Branch from the current Sprint 64-67 working tree.
   - Use `codex/rhythm-section-core-authoring`.
   - Carry the verified layout-style chooser, profile defaults, Simple Chord Sheet lane work, and Sprint 67 workflow lock.

2. Generalize free-hand symbol lanes by layout profile.
   - Simple Chord Sheet supports above/below measure lanes.
   - Rhythm Section Sheet supports below-measure lane only.
   - Lead Sheet has no free-hand symbol lanes for now.

3. Add core measure actions.
   - Convert the Measures tab to an explicit menu.
   - Add `Edit Measures`, `Add Measure at Beginning`, and `Add Measure After Selected`.
   - Preserve existing manual measure-width resizing.

4. Move exact-fit rhythms to auto-render.
   - Exact-fit rhythm passes arm a short grace window, then commit only if the same live canvas snapshot still exactly fits the measure.
   - Underfilled, overflow, and unsupported rhythm passes stay local to the selected measure while the user is still writing.
   - `RhythmicNotationCompendium` gates final values to the supported v1 rhythm vocabulary and exact meter fit before the rhythm map commits.
   - Dirty rhythm ink stays owned by the live `PKCanvasView` during active writing so stale model sync cannot erase fast strokes before persistence or render.
   - Rhythm auto-render reads from a stable live-canvas snapshot instead of persisting raw rhythm ink to the chart model on every idle tick.
   - The exact-fit grace window lets final beams, dots, or rest cleanup strokes cancel and reschedule the pending render before ink clears.
   - Sloped handwritten beams are recognized as beamed-eighth connectors only when they cover two stems, leaving the compendium and exact meter fit as the final gate.
   - Folded beam/right-stem handwriting is recognized as a beamed-eighth connector only when paired with notehead evidence, and protected beamed reads no longer fall through to longer dotted-value reinterpretation when the measure is still underfilled.
   - Auto-render now consumes a `RhythmicNotationMeasureProposal` instead of only a final value list. Exact-fit proposals ending on a quarter-like stem with a playable eighth alternative request an extra stability window, which keeps last-beat beamed-eighth ink from clearing before the beam can land.
   - Rhythm Recognition V2 safety starts at the auto-render boundary: exact-fit values must also be safe to auto-apply before the host clears live ink. Single whole-note or whole-rest measure proposals are kept quantizable but require manual review for now, preventing low-information marks from committing as full measures.
   - Live ink tools expose a left-side write/erase tab. Ink tools always open in write mode, and erase mode wipes only the active live `PKCanvasView` strokes without touching rendered chart items.
   - Post-erase rhythm rendering is stricter but not blocked: erasing an extra symbol can still commit if the remaining ink is naturally exact-fit, while stretched/reinterpreted exact-fit paths stay local until replacement ink is written.
   - Raw-ink beamed-eighth repair: the visual pass now keeps a stemmed notehead from being claimed as an eighth rest before its attached stem/dot can form the intended note, and local touch-up strokes around a beamed pair are included in the protected beamed-eighth event instead of forcing fallback reinterpretation.
   - Follow-up raw-ink evidence showed the pipeline itself is not reliable enough: when the visual pass returns `nil`, fallback meter-fit can still invent an exact measure. Live auto-render and selection finalization now require natural exact fit while Rhythm Recognition V3 rebuilds the recognizer from ordered ink primitives and phrase hypotheses.
   - Rhythm Recognition V3 first slice now adds ordered ink primitives, symbol hypotheses, phrase hypotheses, and explicit `commit` / `keepWriting` / `needsReview` decisions. Live auto-render and tap-away finalization require V3 `commit`; fallback-created exact fits can no longer clear ink.
   - Rhythm Recognition V3 visual-rest slice now promotes quarter rests, half rests, and whole rests into visual phrase hypotheses. Quarter/half rest phrases can commit when naturally exact; single whole-rest measures remain manual-review; quarter-rest bodies are protected from eighth-rest and beamed-eighth stealing.
   - Rhythm Recognition V3 phrase-ambiguity slice now sends tight mixed rest/note clusters to `needsReview(.ambiguousPhrase)`: the manual quantizer can still return the intended values, but live auto-render will not clear ink when adjacent rest and note symbols are visually entangled.
   - Rhythm mode now resolves a real authoring measure when entered, and tapping the already-active Rhythm tab repairs a missing selection instead of only opening the rhythm guide. This keeps the measure-owned rhythm canvas available before the user starts writing.
   - Rhythm auto-render now rechecks a stable stroke-shape snapshot instead of comparing PencilKit serialized `Data`, so metadata churn in an otherwise unchanged live drawing cannot make the pipeline silently go stale.
   - Temporary runtime auto-apply trace logging was removed after the stable snapshot pass was verified; the product path keeps the stable snapshot guard without a new default diagnostic stream.
   - Rhythm Recognition V3 uncovered-ink handling now keeps recognized visual phrases inside the V3 path when extra visible strokes remain: exact visual symbols plus leftover ink become `keepWriting(.uncoveredStrokes)` and do not fall back to legacy meter fitting.
   - Rhythm Recognition V3 competing-exact handling now distinguishes close full-measure alternatives from generic manual review: low-information whole-measure marks stay `needsReview(.manualReview)`, while near-tied exact phrase reads become `needsReview(.competingExactPhrases)`.
   - Rhythm Recognition V3 non-visual-fallback handling now fails closed locally: the manual quantizer can still use the legacy fitter for tooling and diagnostics, but live V3 decisions return `keepWriting(.nonVisualFallback)` with no proposal whenever exact fit depends on the non-visual fallback path.
   - Rhythm unread-ink feedback now draws a local red dashed overlay only for completed-looking non-commit rhythm decisions with a localized unread target. Underfilled/no-ink states stay quiet, commits clear the overlay, and the feedback is not persisted or used as recognizer training.
   - Rhythm unread-ink feedback now targets V3 uncovered-stroke bounds when the decision includes them, so extra unread strokes can be highlighted directly. Broad review/fallback states no longer fall back to framing the whole live drawing.
   - Rhythm Recognition V4 is now implemented as a raster/template phrase gate ahead of the V3 safety bridge. It normalizes live rhythm ink into measure-relative symbol crops, matches those crops against a deterministic visual compendium, validates exact values through `RhythmicNotationCompendium` and `MeasureRhythmMap`, and only commits when visual evidence plus render alignment agree.
   - V4 unread-symbol feedback now targets the failing crop when a visible rhythm symbol cannot be accepted and the phrase is completed-looking. It does not show while the measure is still underfilled, and it does not use whole-frame fallback for broader review states.
   - V4 semantic visual gating now blocks exact-fit commits unless the symbol class has matching evidence: slashes cannot come from stemmed notehead crops, dotted values require detached dot evidence, and single eighth values require flag or beam evidence. Quarter-like unflagged stems may extend stability or produce review, but cannot drive a live auto-render as eighths.
   - V4 rest-crop ownership now keeps strong rest evidence inside rest-only template alternatives, protects strong quarter/half/whole rest matches from the generic eighth-rest hook, and reattaches adjacent eighth-rest dots to following tails after compound symbol splitting.
   - V4 non-exact phrase ownership now keeps strong template underfills and overflows local instead of handing them to older meter-fit paths. Completed unsupported crops stay local with crop-level unread evidence, single-unit unflagged-stem alternatives become manual review only, and beamed-template overcount cases can still fall back to the proven visual bridge.
   - V4 raster normalization now rejects tiny isolated noise marks before crop grouping. Clear phrases can still commit, while meaningful unsupported strokes remain local and can surface crop-level unread feedback.
   - V4 render comparison now has explicit pass/fail coverage: aligned exact phrases can clear the final gate, and exact values with bad visual spacing cannot auto-commit.
   - V4 visual note anchors are now reused by the separate Lead Sheet baseline after the Rhythm Section detour, including separate pitch anchors from beamed-eighth crops. This does not change Rhythm Section rendering, which still treats rhythm maps as slash/rest notation.
   - V4 internals now live in `RhythmicNotationRasterTemplateRecognizer.swift` beside the quantizer, while `RhythmicNotationQuantizer` remains the entrypoint and V3/visual/fallback bridge.
   - Shared proposal, phrase, primitive, decision, reason, candidate, and candidate-path types now live in `RhythmicNotationRecognitionTypes.swift` so the rhythm contract is no longer buried inside the quantizer implementation.

5. Add chord snap visibility.
   - Keep chord insertion/move snapping routed through the existing rhythm-slot and beat fallback helpers.
   - Draw the selected moving chord's guide line to its resolved beat/rhythm attack target.

## Guardrails

- Do not tune chord recognition.
- Do not expand personal handwriting fixtures.
- Do not enable OCR by default.
- Do not add symbol-ledger runtime cost.
- Do not add Section/System layout behavior in this side sprint.
- Lead Sheet pitched-note systems are not owned by this side sprint. The separate main-sprint baseline now uses V4 anchors for clamped in-staff notes without changing Rhythm Section behavior.
