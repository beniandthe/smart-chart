# Smart Chart Sprint 50 Post-Stroke Responsiveness

Status: checks green; awaiting bounded repeat pass

Prior evidence: `docs/smart-chart-sprint-49-flat-root-candidate-availability-2026-05-26.md`

## Purpose

Sprint 50 makes the writing-to-render loop feel a little quicker after the final ink stroke now that Sprint 49 restored `Db7(b9)` candidate availability.

This is a scheduler polish sprint, not recognition training. Do not add personal handwriting fixtures, retune scores, expand OCR authority, or enable symbol-ledger diagnostics by default.

## Sprint 49 Repeat Pass Evidence

Metadata source inspected locally:

- app data: CoreSimulator app container `Library/Application Support/SmartChart`
- chart ID: `ED98F246-3A73-493C-BF8A-9106DAE76F04`
- diagnostics: `chord-entry-diagnostics.jsonl`

Observed result:

| Case | Result | Timing classification | Recognition classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `C` | Auto-rendered | `575ms` scheduled-to-finished on the final root-continuation pass, `1ms` recognition, `32ms` render handoff | Stable clear root case |
| `G/B` | Auto-rendered | `890ms` scheduled-to-finished, `2ms` recognition, `12ms` render handoff | Stable slash case |
| `Db7(b9)` | Auto-rendered | `908ms` scheduled-to-finished, `19ms` recognition, `10ms` render handoff | Sprint 49 fix worked; root-bearing candidates were available |

Key signal:

- The user reported the pass felt smooth and all three cases auto-rendered correctly.
- The remaining felt delay is mostly intentional scheduler wait after ink settles, not recognizer compute, proposal/commit time, or render handoff.

## What Changed

- Normal chord-ink idle delay moved from `0.85s` to `0.75s`.
- Root-only continuation grace moved from `0.55s` to `0.40s`.
- Extension prefixes still keep the full `1.2s` continuation grace.
- Slash chords and altered chords still do not use continuation grace.

Expected product impact:

- A clear root-only case such as `C` can propose after about `1.15s` of scheduler time instead of about `1.40s`.
- Slash and altered chords can propose after about `0.75s` of idle time instead of about `0.85s`.
- Multi-stroke extension prefixes remain protected from premature render by the full continuation grace.

## Behavior Boundary

- No personal handwriting fixture was imported.
- No recognition score was retuned.
- No OCR authority changed.
- No symbol-ledger diagnostics were enabled.
- No export/share or ink-clearing behavior changed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Scheduling policy tests prove the new conservative delay budget.
- Writing-to-render readiness tests still pass.
- Full SwiftPM and iOS simulator scheme tests pass before closeout.
- One bounded repeat pass confirms `C`, `G/B`, and `Db7(b9)` still auto-render correctly and feel at least as smooth as Sprint 49.

## Next Bounded Pass

After checks pass, run one short pass:

- `C`
- `G/B`
- `Db7(b9)`

Expected observation:

- `C` should feel a bit quicker after the last stroke without rendering before the chord is finished.
- `G/B` and `Db7(b9)` should still auto-render correctly.
- Ink should clear after render.
